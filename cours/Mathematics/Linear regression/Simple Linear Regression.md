In simple linear regression, you're dealing with one independent variable and one dependent variable. The model is defined as:

**The Linear Equation:**

The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is modeled as a linear equation:

**2. Data Collection:**

You gather a dataset that includes both the independent variable (�X) and the dependent variable (�Y). For example, you might collect data on the number of hours students study (�X) and their corresponding exam scores (�Y).

**3. Data Visualization:**

Before applying Simple Linear Regression, it's helpful to visualize the data with a scatter plot to get an initial sense of the relationship between �X and �Y. This can reveal whether there appears to be a linear trend.

**4. Model Training:**

The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted values (based on the linear equation) and the actual data points. This is typically done using the method of least squares, which aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the predicted and actual values.

**5. Coefficient Estimation:**

**6. Model Evaluation:**

**7. Prediction:**

After the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions for new or unseen data. Given a value of X, you can use the linear equation to predict the corresponding Y.

Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental technique for modeling and understanding the relationship between two variables and making predictions based on that relationship. It serves as a basis for more complex regression techniques and is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, science, and engineering.
