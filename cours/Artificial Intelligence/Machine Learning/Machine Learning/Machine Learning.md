`Anything you can do with 1 second of thought we can probably now or soon automate.`

The rise of AI has been largely driven by one tool in AI called **Machine Learning**

**Machine learning** is subset of Al that tries to solve a specific problem and make predictions using data

**Machine learning** is a subdomain of computer science that focuses on algorithms which help a computer learn from data without explicit programming 

**Machine Learning** is a branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following a fixed set of rules, machine learning models learn from data and adapt their behavior based on the patterns they discover in that data.

**Data:** The foundation of machine learning is data. It provides the necessary information for the model to learn and make predictions. The quality and quantity of data play a significant role in the effectiveness of the model.
