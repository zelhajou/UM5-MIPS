Imagine you have a bunch of colorful blocks, and you want to do some cool things with them. **Linear algebra** is like a set of rules that helps you play with these blocks.

1. **Blocks (Vectors):** In linear algebra, we call these colorful blocks "vectors." Vectors are like arrows that point in a certain direction and have a length. The length represents how many blocks there are in that direction.
    
2. **Adding Vectors:** You can add vectors together by putting their starting points together and then following the new arrow to the ending point. It's like putting blocks on top of each other to see how many you have in total.
    
3. **Scaling Vectors:** You can also make vectors longer or shorter by multiplying them by a number. This is like stretching or squeezing the blocks.
    
4. **Matrix:** Imagine you have a big table, and each row of the table is a vector. This table is called a "matrix." You can do cool things with matrices, like adding them together, multiplying them, and more.
    
5. **Matrix Multiplication:** When you multiply a matrix by a vector, it's like taking one big vector and following the rules in the matrix to get a new vector. It's a bit like doing a special dance with your blocks to get a new set of blocks.
    
6. **Solving Problems:** Linear algebra helps you solve problems and answer questions. For example, if you have a bunch of equations and you want to find the values that make them all true, you can use linear algebra to solve the puzzle.
    

So, think of linear algebra as the rules for playing with colorful blocks (vectors) and tables (matrices) to do cool things like adding, stretching, and finding answers to questions. It's like a superpower for solving math and science problems!


# Linear algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. Linear algebra primarily focuses on the study of vectors, vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations.

```
In a sample or introductory context, linear algebra serves as a foundation for understanding how mathematical concepts are used to represent and manipulate data, perform calculations, and solve problems involving vectors, matrices, and linear equations. It is a fundamental part of mathematics with wide-ranging applications across various disciplines.
```


linear algebra is a powerful tool used for tasks like transforming and analyzing data. Let's illustrate this with an example:

### **Example: Image Transformation**

Imagine you have a black-and-white image, like a simple drawing. Each pixel in the image can be represented as a point in a grid. Each point has a brightness value, which is a number.

1. **Image as a Grid:** You can think of the image as a grid of points, where each point represents a pixel. Each pixel's brightness is a number, and these numbers can be organized into a matrix. So, you can represent the entire image as a matrix.
    
2. **Matrix Operations:** Now, you want to apply some transformations to this image, like making it larger, rotating it, or adding a filter effect. These transformations can be represented as matrices. For example, a scaling transformation can be represented by a scaling matrix.
    
3. **Matrix Multiplication:** To apply a transformation to the image, you multiply the original image matrix by the transformation matrix using matrix multiplication rules. This process changes the pixel values in the matrix and transforms the image accordingly.
    
4. **Result:** After multiplying the matrices, you get a new matrix that represents the transformed image. You can then display this new matrix as an image, and it will show the original image but with the applied transformation.
```
Linear algebra helps you perform these operations efficiently. It allows you to describe complex transformations in a simple and systematic way using matrices. In this example, linear algebra is used to manipulate and analyze image data, but it's also crucial in various other fields like physics, engineering, machine learning, and more, where data and relationships between data need to be understood and manipulated mathematically.

## Vectors and Matrices

vectors and matrices are fundamental mathematical structures used to represent and manipulate data, transformations, and equations.

**Vectors:**

- A vector is a mathematical object that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction. It is often depicted as an arrow in space.
- In linear algebra, vectors are typically represented as ordered lists of numbers. For example, a 2D vector might be represented as (x, y), and a 3D vector as (x, y, z).
- Vectors can be used to represent various types of data, such as position, velocity, force, or any other physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
- In linear algebra, vectors can be added together, scaled (multiplied) by a number, and used to perform operations like dot products and cross products.

**Matrices:**

- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Each entry in a matrix is called an element.
- Matrices are used to represent data, transformations, and systems of linear equations. They are versatile tools in linear algebra.
- A matrix with M rows and N columns is referred to as an "M x N" matrix. For example, a 2x3 matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.
- Matrices can be added together, multiplied by scalars, and multiplied with other matrices. Matrix multiplication is a crucial operation in linear algebra.
- Matrices are used to represent linear transformations, where a vector is transformed into another vector through matrix-vector multiplication.
- Systems of linear equations can be represented using matrices and solved using techniques like Gaussian elimination or matrix inverses.

```
In summary, vectors are one-dimensional arrays that represent quantities with both magnitude and direction, while matrices are two-dimensional arrays used to represent various types of data and transformations in linear algebra. Both vectors and matrices play a central role in solving problems related to linear equations, transformations, and data manipulation in mathematics and various scientific and engineering fields.

## Vector operations :

Vector operations are mathematical operations that you can perform on vectors (quantities that have both magnitude and direction).

1. **Vector Addition (Summation):**
    - You can add two vectors together by adding their corresponding components (elements). If you have vectors A and B, the sum A + B is computed as (A₁ + B₁, A₂ + B₂, ..., Aₙ + Bₙ), where A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ are the components of vector A and B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ are the components of vector B
	
2. **Vector Subtraction:**
    - To subtract one vector from another, you subtract their corresponding components. For example, A - B is computed as (A₁ - B₁, A₂ - B₂, ..., Aₙ - Bₙ).
    
3. **Scalar Multiplication:**
    - You can multiply a vector by a scalar (a single number). Each component of the vector is multiplied by the scalar value. For example, if you multiply vector A by the scalar c, you get cA = (cA₁, cA₂, ..., cAₙ).


**Addition and subtraction of Vectors using NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two vectors as NumPy arrays
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Perform vector addition
result_vector = vector1 + vector2

# Perform vector subtraction
result_vector2 = vector1 - vector2

print("Vector1:", vector1)
print("Vector2:", vector2)
print("Result (Addition):", result_vector)
print("Result (Subtraction):", result_vector2)

```

## Matrix operations :

Matrix operations are mathematical operations performed on matrices, which are rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns.

```
You can perform addition and subtraction on matrices and vectors using the NumPy library in Python. NumPy provides efficient tools for working with arrays, including matrices and vectors.
```

1. **Matrix Addition and Subtraction:**
    
    - Matrices of the same size (having the same number of rows and columns) can be added or subtracted element-wise. If you have matrices A and B of the same size, their sum A + B or difference A - B is computed by adding or subtracting their corresponding elements.
      
      ```python
import numpy as np

# Create two matrices as NumPy arrays
matrix1 = np.array([/[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([/[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Perform matrix addition
result_matrix = matrix1 + matrix2

# Perform matrix subtraction 
result_matrix2 = matrix1 - matrix2

print("Matrix1:\n", matrix1)
print("Matrix2:\n", matrix2)

print("Result (Addition):\n", result_matrix)
print("Result (Subtraction):\n", result_matrix2)

```

2. **Scalar Multiplication:**
    
    - You can multiply a matrix by a scalar (a single number). Each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar value. If you have a matrix A and a scalar c, the result of the scalar multiplication is cA, where each element of A is multiplied by c.
      
3. **Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (Matrix Product):**
    
    - Matrix multiplication is a crucial operation in linear algebra. It involves multiplying two matrices to produce a new matrix. To multiply matrices A (m x n) and B (n x p), the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B. The resulting matrix C (m x p) is computed as C = AB, where each element of C is determined by taking the dot product of a row from A and a column from B.
      ![[Pasted image 20230902122322.png]]
      
```python
import numpy as np

# Define two matrices with specified shapes
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: 2x3
matrix2 = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])  # Shape: 3x2

# Perform matrix-matrix multiplication
result = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)

# Alternatively, you can use the "@" operator for matrix-matrix multiplication:
# result = matrix1 @ matrix2

print("Matrix1 (2x3):\n", matrix1)
print("Matrix2 (3x2):\n", matrix2)
print("Result (Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) - Shape: {}:\n".format(result.shape), result)
```
      
4. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication:**
    
    - You can multiply a matrix A (m x n) by a vector x (n x 1) to produce a new vector y (m x 1). Each element of y is calculated as the dot product of a row from A and the vector x. The result is y = Ax.
      ![[Pasted image 20230902121031.png]]
     
      ```python
import numpy as np

# Define a matrix (2x3) and a vector (3x1)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

vector = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Perform matrix-vector multiplication
result = np.dot(matrix, vector)

# Alternatively, you can use the "@" operator for matrix-vector multiplication:
# result = matrix @ vector

print("Matrix:\n", matrix)
print("Vector:\n", vector)
print("Result (Matrix-Vector Multiplication):\n", result)

```

5. **Matrix Transposition:**
	- The transpose of a matrix A, denoted as A^T or Aᵀ, is obtained by swapping its rows and columns. If A is an m x n matrix, its transpose A^T is an n x m matrix, and the (i, j)-th element of A^T is the same as the (j, i)-th element of A.
	  ![[Pasted image 20230902124807.png]]
	  
	  ```python
import numpy as np

# Create a matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Transpose the matrix using the .T attribute
transposed_matrix = matrix.T

# Alternatively, you can use numpy.transpose()
# transposed_matrix = np.transpose(matrix)

print("Original Matrix:\n", matrix)
print("Transposed Matrix:\n", transposed_matrix)
```

6. **Matrix Inverse (if exists):**
	- Not all matrices have inverses, but if a square matrix A has an inverse, denoted as A⁻¹, then multiplying A by its inverse results in the identity matrix I (A⁻¹A = I). The inverse of a matrix allows solving linear systems of equations and other mathematical operations.
	  ![[Pasted image 20230902124843.png]]
	  
	  A matrix inverse is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, gives the identity matrix as the result. The identity matrix is a special square matrix with ones on its main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. In other words, if you have a matrix A and you multiply it by its inverse A⁻¹, you get the identity matrix I:
	  
	  A * A⁻¹ = I
	  
	  However, not all matrices have inverses. For a matrix to have an inverse, it must be a square matrix (the number of rows equals the number of columns), and its determinant must be non-zero.
	  
	  Here's an example of finding the inverse of a square matrix using NumPy in Python:
	  
	```python
import numpy as np

# Define a square matrix
matrix = np.array([[2, 1],
                   [5, 3]])

# Calculate the determinant of the matrix
determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix)

# Check if the determinant is non-zero (a necessary condition for having an inverse)
if determinant != 0:
    # Calculate the inverse of the matrix
    inverse_matrix = np.linalg.inv(matrix)
    
    print("Original Matrix:\n", matrix)
    print("Determinant:", determinant)
    print("Inverse Matrix:\n", inverse_matrix)
else:
    print("The matrix does not have an inverse because its determinant is zero.")
    ```
	  
	  In this example, we first define a square matrix. We then calculate its determinant using `np.linalg.det(matrix)`. If the determinant is non-zero, we proceed to calculate the inverse of the matrix using `np.linalg.inv(matrix)`.
	  
	  If the determinant is zero, it means that the matrix does not have an inverse, and attempting to find the inverse would result in an error. Therefore, it's important to check the determinant before attempting to find the inverse of a matrix.
	  
	  The inverse of a matrix is useful in solving systems of linear equations, performing transformations, and various mathematical calculations.
	  
6. **Matrix Determinant:**
    
    - The determinant of a square matrix A, denoted as det(A) or |A|, is a scalar value that provides information about the matrix's properties. The determinant is used to check if a matrix has an inverse and has applications in solving systems of linear equations and calculating volumes.
7. **Matrix Trace:**
    
    - The trace of a square matrix A, denoted as tr(A), is the sum of its diagonal elements (from the top-left to the bottom-right). The trace is often used in various mathematical calculations.


## Relation between Matrices and ML:

#### Example : Image in Matrix in python 

You can use the popular library OpenCV to work with images as matrices. OpenCV allows you to load, manipulate, and process images efficiently. Here's a basic example of how to load an image, view it as a matrix, and perform some basic operations using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load an image (replace 'your_image.jpg' with the path to your image)
image = cv2.imread('cat2.jpg')

# Check if the image was loaded successfully
if image is None:
    print("Error: Unable to load the image.")
else:
    # Display the original image
    plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    plt.title("Original Image")
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
    
    # Get image dimensions (height, width, and number of color channels)
    height, width, channels = image.shape
    print("Image Dimensions: {} x {} x {}".format(height, width, channels))
    
    # Convert the image to grayscale
    grayscale_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Display the grayscale image
    plt.imshow(grayscale_image, cmap='gray')
    plt.title("Grayscale Image")
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

    # Crop a region of interest (ROI)
    x, y, w, h = 100, 50, 200, 150  # Define the ROI coordinates and size
    roi = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]     # Crop the ROI from the original image
    
    # Display the cropped ROI
    plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(roi, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    plt.title("Cropped ROI")
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()
```

In this example:

1. We load an image using `cv2.imread()` (replace `'your_image.jpg'` with the path to your image).
2. We display the original image using `matplotlib`.
3. We extract and print the image dimensions, which include height, width, and the number of color channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images).
4. We convert the image to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()`.
5. We display the grayscale image.
6. We crop a region of interest (ROI) from the original image, display it, and save it as `roi`.
