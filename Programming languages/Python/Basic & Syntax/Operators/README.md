# Operators

In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process. For instance, "x" is an arithmetic operator that indicates multiplication, while "&&" is a logical operator representing the logical AND function in programming.
# Arithmetic Operators

```c
+, -, *, /, % (modulo).
```

# Comparison Operators

```c
==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
```

# Logical Operators

```c
&& (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).

Python: and (logical AND), or (logical OR), not (logical NOT).
```

# Assignment Operators

```c
= (assignment), +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
```

# Bitwise Operators (C, Java)

```c
&, |, ^ (XOR), ~ (complement), << (left shift), >> (right shift).
```
