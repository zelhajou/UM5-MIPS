Project ideas : 

- **Object Detection and Recognition for Retail:** Develop a computer vision system that can detect and recognize products on store shelves. This can assist retailers in managing inventory, monitoring shelf stock, and providing real-time product information to customers.
- **Medical Image Analysis:** Build a system that can analyze medical images such as X-rays, MRI scans, or histopathological slides to assist in disease diagnosis and detection. This can aid healthcare professionals in making more accurate and efficient diagnoses.
- **Image Captioning:** Develop a model that generates captions or descriptions for images. The system should analyze the visual content of the image and generate meaningful and contextually relevant captions.
- **Plant Disease Detection:** Create a system that can detect and diagnose plant diseases based on images of leaves or other plant parts. This project can aid farmers in early disease detection and prevent crop loss.
- **Medical Imaging Diagnosis:** Create a computer vision system that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing diseases or conditions based on medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI images.
- **Image-based Geographical Landmark Recognition**: Create a system that can recognize famous landmarks and geographical locations from images, providing information and context about the places.
