`Artificial intelligence is an area of computer science, where the goal is to enable computers and machines to perform human-like tasks and simulate human behavior`

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines and systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. In other words, AI aims to develop computer programs that can think, reason, learn, and make decisions in a way similar to humans.

AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, approaches, and applications, and it can be divided into two main categories:
1.  **Narrow or Weak AI:** This type of AI is designed to excel in a specific task or a limited set of tasks. Examples of narrow AI include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems used by streaming services, and autonomous vehicles. These systems are highly specialized and lack general intelligence.
   ```
- Weak AI : informational processing machines that appear to have all the mental capacities of living humans or animals, but are not alive. They do not have conscious experience.

- Narrow AI :the process of making a computer system that can do specific tasks or things that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language and recognizing objects
```
2. **General or Strong AI:** This is a more advanced form of AI that would possess human-like cognitive abilities and be capable of understanding and performing any intellectual task that a human can do. General AI is still a theoretical concept and has not been fully realized.
```
- Strong AI: artificial persons or creatures that are alive, meaning they I have all the mental capacities, including self-awareness and consciousness

- General AI: can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can. The performance of these systems is indistinguishable from that of a human.
  The broad intellectual capacities of AGI would exceed human capacities because of its ability to access and process huge data sets at incredible speeds
```

| Narrow A.I| A.G.I |
| -------- | -------- |
| Limited to Specific Tasks | Perform General Intelligent Actions |
| Fixed Models Provided by Programmers | Self-leaning and Self-reasoning |
| No Transfer of Knowledge | Can Leverage knowledge different Tasks |

`according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak Al, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.`

**AI** systems work by processing vast amounts of data ([[Data Science]]), using algorithms to identify patterns and correlations within the data, and then using these patterns to make predictions or decisions. The learning process is a crucial aspect of AI, allowing machines to improve their performance over time as they gather more data and learn from their experiences.

Some of the prominent subfields within AI include:

- **[[Machine Learning]] (ML):** A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.
    
- **[[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]]:** The ability of machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    
- **[[Computer Vision]]:** AI systems that can interpret and understand visual information from images or videos.
    
- **Robotics:** The integration of AI into robotic systems to enable them to perform tasks autonomously and interact with their environment.
